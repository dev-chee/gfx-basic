/// A set of [Euler angles] representing a rotation in three-dimensional space.
///
/// The axis rotation sequence is XYZ. That is, the rotation is first around
/// the X axis, then the Y axis, and lastly the Z axis (using intrinsic
/// rotations). Since all three rotation axes are used, the angles are
/// Taitâ€“Bryan angles rather than proper Euler angles.
///
/// # Ranges
///
/// - x: [-pi, pi]
/// - y: [-pi/2, pi/2]
/// - z: [-pi, pi]
///
/// # Defining rotations using Euler angles
///
/// Note that while [Euler angles] are intuitive to define, they are prone to
/// [gimbal lock] and are challenging to interpolate between. Instead we
/// recommend that you convert them to a more robust representation, such as a
/// quaternion or a rotation matrix. To this end, `From<Euler<A>>` conversions
/// are provided for the following types:
